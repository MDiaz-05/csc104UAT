            <p> I my name is Oscar but the art name I go by is Beanie, hence why all my artwork is signed with it. </p>
            <p>I like to create a lot of concept art and concept art. Me personally, like to keep the look and feel of my artwork kind of surrealistic. I have the mini art collection 
                called abstract women. It is a line of artwork I've made where I replace heads wit different things from clouds, ghosts, candy etc.
