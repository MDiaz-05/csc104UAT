For the FAQ page, besides the hyper navbar I have on all the pages I added some interactive sections. I used things like summary and details to add drop down icon
 for questions people might have that are pretty common. It filled with a bunch of fillers since it is just a layout 


my css style sheet has the finished navigation bar, as well as layout for certain elements and tags. 

I need to edit the code on my portfolio page, when I tried to add the button it merged wih the image collage. I tried to get a basic fromat down. I do know I need to code my images beteer 
since I will be using those instead of dots for listed items. I also need to figure out a way to have the submitted text clear once you finish typing. However, the contact page does 
clearly have a contact table/forum. 

My homeepage is going to have my logo or a self portrait of myself and a description of what I do and my work experience, I added filler text. 
The portfolio page has a visually appealing photo collage set up sinc this page will only be images. I feel like a streched my skills out for this. I feel like I made a lot of progress
comared to my first website, not from this class but my coding class I took before college. I feel like I can do more.
