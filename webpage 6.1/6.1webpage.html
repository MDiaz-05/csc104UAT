               Margaret Keane was an American artist who gained popularity within the 1950's and 60's. She was well known for her paintings of children with these really big eyes.
               The reason why these paintings had such big eyes is because Margaret during her childhood had eardrum damage. This made her pay more attention to expressions to amplify
               what people said. Fun fact it was her paitings that inspired the design for the Power Puff Girls  
               Even Tim Burton directed a film about her called Big Eyes in 2014. Except the problem was that she wasn't recongized as the artist...rather her husband was.  
               This began due to her second husband, Walter Keane. He was quite the saleman. He began to promote her work while claiming himself as the artist 
               given that both of their last names are Keane and thats how the paintings were signed. these paintings kept rising to popularity to the point Mr. Keane decdied to donate 
               it to the United Nations Children's Fund in 1961. For years Walter Keane would explot his wife's work making a huge business from it. He would open up many galleries,
               make his wife do comissioned work, sell prints of her work including: posters, postcards, mugs, etc. Margaret sound it hard to stand up for herself due to how long this issued had 
               snowballed for. It wasn't until 1965 where she took Walter Keane to court. The best part? What proved that she was an artist was Mr and Ms Keane had to paint during court. 
               This was to prove who the real artist was. Margaret found this easy while Walter kept making excuses for why he couldn't paint. She struggled to get her name out but at 
               the end she finally got ownership of her own work.
